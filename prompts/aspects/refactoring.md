## Refactoring Scope

Refactoring suggestions are optional improvements. They must not block a PR.

## Refactoring Focus Areas

- Duplication near the changed code
- Overly complex conditionals that can be simplified
- Small extraction opportunities (functions, constants)
- Naming and structure improvements in the immediate vicinity

## Refactoring-Specific Priority Guidelines

IMPORTANT: Use only P2 and P3 for refactoring suggestions. Never use P0 or P1.
